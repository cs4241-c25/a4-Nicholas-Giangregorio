I went with option 1 for this.

The Recipe Organizer allows users to add, view, edit, and delete recipes (or at least it used to). On the backend, I set up API routes to handle these operations and confirmed that data was being correctly stored in the MongoDB database. However, I encountered issues with fetching and displaying the recipes on the frontend, and spent several hours trying to get it to work to no avail. This surprised me, as I had no issue getting the list of users or adding recipes to the database. This ate up all my remaining time and the main functionality is not present.
